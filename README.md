Torre technical test - Marlon Pinto
This repository is a technical test to show my skills in both back-end and front-end for a Torre.co internship as a fullstack developer. This document contains a progress log of exploring, planning and development to achieve the objective of the test.

Exploring Stage :
The first step is based on reviewing information sources that can serve to contextualize and familiarize myself with the characteristics of Torre to focus future ideas in relation to the interests of the platform.

-https://torre.co

-https://docsend.com/view/c6pecie

-https://impactotic.co/torre-co-la-plataforma-para-encontrar-nuevos-talentos-y-trabajadores-remotos/

Also dedicate a training period to make use of github, the vue.js framework and Postman, as tools that I am interested in learning to use and that will be useful in the development stage.

CONCEPTS TO CONSIDER:

Matching for the flexible workforce
Platforms for automated, data-driven recruiting
Remote Teams
Professional genomes
Viral recommendations
AI friendly
Professional Digital Profile
The end of this stage is dedicated to reviewing the information that is accessed through the Endpoints sent by the email that defines the test.

Planning Stage:
I drew on my own experience with the use of the Torre.co website and expectations when seeking an internship through it. The idea is a complementary introduction proposal for the platform, where the genome construction process, the consignment of work history and projects are taken into account, but users without work experience and close to degrees are considered as the main candidates to apply to "internship" type jobs. Additionally, due to the remote work modality for which the platform is directed, an information section is provided on how to carry out this work properly, including infographics, banners and links to other potentially allied pages that provide them.
